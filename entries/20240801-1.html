        <h2>A legitimiate, innovative use for AI art?</h2>
        <h3>20240801-1</h3>
        <p>The current state of AI art makes it so that reality is unable to be fully represented 1:1. It can get close, but it almost feels like a pastiche of the work it's emulating/deriving from.</p>
        <p>AI is constantly used to <em>disinform</em>. Could that be its "flagship"? The act of disinforming is inherent to its medium.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>IT CANNOT ACCURATELY REPRESENT INFORMATION on a technical level</li>
            <li>IT IS USED TO REPRESENT THE REALITY OF SOMETHING, BUT DUE TO 1., it inherently cannot do so, being misinforrmation by a technicality.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is an uncanny feeling aobut AI art. Vicerally, humans look at it and can (usually) tell.</p>
        <p>Maybe the act of the work and experiencing are twofold:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The creation is <em>simulating</em>. It is used to attempt emulating reality. It pretends, and attempts to be real to the viewer. OR/AND...</li>
            <li>The creation is <em>playing a role</em>. Because of inherent flaws in representing reality, all involved in the experience understand its lack of reality despite it best efforts. All understand its "fakeness", its emulation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Maybe the fakeness <em>is</em> its inherent form. It's uncanny, it tries to edge closer to reality but crucially must fail. By a technicality, failing to be reality is misinforrmation. A viewer knows it to be false. The creator too.</p>
        <p>"The medium is the message." ITS ATTEMPT TO REPRESENT REALITY IS THE SIGNIFICANCE, THE MEANING, THE EXPERIENCE.</p>
