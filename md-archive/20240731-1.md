# King's Soliloquy - Scott Road

## 20240731-1 (orig. 20240725)

Yeah I'm the new-born king now  
I do whatever I please  
Why don't you make yourself useful  
Why don't you get on your knees.

(And he was a devil)  
(He made sure we knew)  
(Among the people)  
(This was Armageddon)  

Yeah, and now you're nothing  
I've got a city to burn  
You won't love me  
Ashes into urns  

(And what a wreck it was)  
(His paper crown alive)  
(Adored by many)  
(Unbeknownst to him)  

...

I'm tired of all the pretty boys  
Who think they're

*   they're better than me
*   they're just like me

I'll kick your god-damned face in  
As far as you won't see  

No longer will my subjects  
sneer towards my presence  
And I'll have cut my way  
Through others, ladies & gents!  

...

Yeah now I'm at my breaking point  
Your profile eggs me on  
Why won't you look my way  
Why don't you, why don't you
